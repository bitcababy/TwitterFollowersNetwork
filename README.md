# TwitterFollowersNetwork

This package aims to create Twitter followers and following networks using R software and Twitter API.  
I've found that those function existed on Python but not R so I try to develop my own  

Since it is based on the API and that getting the names of accounts can be pretty heavy if there is a lot, the process is sometime very long : 20 minutes for ~ 15 accounts, hours for ~ 50 accounts and maybe days for more than 100 accounts  

Those function needs rtweet package in order to work properly  

Every comment or suggestion is welcome !
